         <p>In one of the strangest celebrity purchases of the year, Oscar-winning actor <em>Ethan Greer</em> has reportedly shelled out a whopping <strong>$50 million</strong> for a sprawling Gothic mansion in upstate New York—known locally as <em>The Whispering Manor</em>.</p>
         <p>The estate, built in the 1800s, has a reputation for being haunted, with previous owners abandoning it due to <q>unexplained phenomena.</q></p>

         <p>But here's where it gets even juicier: <strong>Ethan's ex</strong>, singer <em>Jenna Sky</em>, is rumored to have warned him against the purchase, citing a past incident where she experienced <q>terrifying visions</q> during a visit to the mansion years ago. Despite her warning, Ethan seems unbothered.</p>
         <p>His cryptic comment? <q>I'm not afraid of a few ghosts. I'm more afraid of living a boring life.</q> Sources say the actor plans to use the property as a retreat for writing his debut novel. </p>
